## Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio repository! This repository showcases various projects and analyses I've worked on related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. Each project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks with explanations, code, and visualizations.

Projects Included

1. Project 1: SPACEX Falcon 9 Predictions
   - Description: Predicting whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. In this project I performed Exploratory Data Analysis where I collected data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings. I use a RESTful API and web scraping and converted the data into a dataframe and then performed some data wrangling. I built a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash and built an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium. Moving on to the final stage of Predictive Analysis, in which I used machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. I splited the data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then find the method that performs best using test data.
